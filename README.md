DESCRIPTION:
    src: The main folder of the application containing all the files.
        index.js: The entry point of the application that renders the main component.
        App.js: The main component that organizes the application and defines the routes.
        Home.js: The homepage that presents other components.
        components: A folder that includes all reusable components:
            Header.js: Header component.
            Footer.js: Footer component.
            Hero.js: Hero section component.
            Product.js: Component for displaying individual products.
            ProductDetails.js: Component for showing product details.
            CartItem.js: Component for displaying items in the cart.
            Sidebar.js: Component for the sidebar functionality.
        contexts: A folder that contains state management with contexts:
            CartContext.js: Context for managing the shopping cart.
            ProductContext.js: Context for managing the list of products.
            SidebarContext.js: Context for managing the sidebar state.

RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN FILES:
- Context Providers:
The contexts (CartContext, ProductContext, and SidebarContext) are established at the root level in index.js.
This allows all components to access the shared state they provide.
- Component Communication:
Components like Header, Sidebar, and CartItem access the CartContext to retrieve and modify cart-related data.
Product and ProductDetails components use ProductContext to get the list of products and details about individual products.
- State Management:
When a user interacts with the UI (like adding items to the cart), the respective context provider updates the state.
This triggers a re-render of all components that depend on that state, ensuring the UI is always up-to-date.
- Routing:
App.js sets up the routing between different components, such as navigating from the home page to product details.
This navigation is managed with react-router-dom, ensuring a smooth user experience.

SUMMARY
This project structure provides a clear separation of concerns, where contexts manage state and components handle presentation.
Each file plays a distinct role, ensuring the application is modular and easy to maintain.
Using context providers helps in avoiding prop drilling and makes the application scalable as more features are added.
